We were a team in a web development class organized by Kominfo and partnered
with Progate. The program of this commission called Digital Talent Scholarship,
the program itself is designed for Indonesian youth to be prepared for
the development of the digital industry 4.0.
In the web development class, we were guided by progate, by good people who
patiently taught us the skill, whether it was hard skills or soft skills,
Ranging from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and also how
to be a good team on a project.
